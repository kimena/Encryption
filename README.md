# Encryption
This package is used to encrypt and decrypt text of a given alphabet using private key encryption.
Three ciphers are currently implemented: Affine, Vigenere, and a custom Matrix cipher.

The package includes a set of matrix and ring packages to allow for multiple strategies with both matrices and encryption.
